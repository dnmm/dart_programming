# 1. Dart function :
Dart function is a set of codes that together perform a specific task. It is used to break the large code into smaller modules and reuse it when needed. Functions make the program more readable and easy to debug. It improves the modular approach and enhances the code reusability.

// A simple function without parameters
void sayHello() {
  print('Hello, Dart!');
}
# 2. Anonymous function :
