# Control flow statement 
In Dart, control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in your code. They include if statements, for loops, while loops, do-while loops, switch statements, and the break and continue keywords. 

1.if Statements:the if statement allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true:
2. for Loops:the for loop is used to iterate over a range of values
3. while Loops:The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true:
4. do-while Loops:The do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition:

5. switch Statements:The switch statement allows you to select one of many blocks of code to execute:

6. break Statement:The break statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement
7. continue Statement:The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
