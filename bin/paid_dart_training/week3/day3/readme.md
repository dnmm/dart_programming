# if-else-if statement:
An if-else if statement in programming is a control flow statement that allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. It executes a block of code if the first condition is true, and if that condition is false, it checks the next condition. This pattern continues until a condition is true or until there are no more conditions to check. 
void main() {  
var marks = 74;     
if(marks > 85)  
{  
       print("Excellent");  
}  
 else if(marks>75)  
{  
      print("Very Good");  
}   
else if(marks>65)  
{  
      print("Good");  
}  
else  
 {  
      print("Average");  
}  
}  


# switchcase:
Dart Switch case statement is used to avoid the long chain of the if-else statement.
The value of the variable compares with the multiple cases, and if a match is found, then it executes a block of statement associated with that particular case.
