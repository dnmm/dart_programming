# 1.Oops concepts:
Dart is an object-oriented programming language, and it supports all the concepts of object-oriented programming such as classes, object, inheritance, mixin, and abstract classes.



# 2. class and object:
A class can contain fields, functions, constructors, etc. It is a wrapper that binds/encapsulates the data and functions together; that can be accessed by creating an object. A class can refer to as user-define data type which defines characteristics by its all objects.
Syntax:

var object_name  = new class_name(<constructor_arguments>);
